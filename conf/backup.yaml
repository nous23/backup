#   - src: C:\Users\Public\Documents
#     dst: D:\BACKUP
#     period: 1d
#     name: my_1st_backup_task
#     filtered_files:
#       - *.ini
#       - hello.txt
#   - src: D:\Work
# Here we created two backup tasks.
# The first one, named my_1st_backup_task, backup C:\Users\Public\Documents to D:\BACKUP, filtering all files
# ended up with .ini and files named hello.txt, will be executed 1 time 1 day.
# The second one, backup D:\Work to default_dst, filtering all files in default_filtered_file, with period default_period.
